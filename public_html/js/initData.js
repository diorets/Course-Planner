Concepts of materiality and audit risk are examined and discussed. Sources and techniques for gathering auditing evidence will also be examined. Modern organizations rely on information systems, technology and internal controls to manage and monitor their operations and the impact of these systems on the quality of information produced and on the scope of audits are important elements of this course.  |%Accounting|ACCT*3330|Intermediate Financial Accounting I|F,W|(3-0)|[0.50]| Also offered through Distance Education format. | ACCT*1220 or ACCT*2220 || BUS*3330 ||| Department of Management |This course presents a critical evaluation of accounting concepts, principles and practices in relation to both the traditional and current value accounting measurement models.

Rather than covering specific GAAP rules, the course will focus on how investors react to GAAP rules, why financial information is important, and how its use/misuse affects investor decision making and management behaviour. The course is thus about accounting, instead of about how to apply accounting standards.  |%Accounting|ACCT*4350|Income Taxation II|F|(3-0)|[0.50]|| ACCT*3350 or BUS*3350 || BUS*4350 ||| Department of Management |An intensive study of the Canadian Income Tax Act and related statutes, this course will focus on the application to the taxation of individuals, partnerships and corporations.
